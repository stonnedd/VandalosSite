## What's mongoose-attachments?

Mongoose-Attachments is an attachments plugin for [Mongoose.js](http://mongoosejs.com/). It handles ImageMagick transformations for the following providers:


### Stable Release

You're reading the documentation for the next release of Mongoose-Attachments, which should be 0.1.0.
The current stable release is [0.0.4](https://github.com/firebaseco/mongoose-attachments/blob/v0.0.4).

Currently, Mongoose-Attachments is undergoing restructuring as we are moving the different storage
providers into submodules. If you plan to use 0.0.4, do make sure that you use the [documentation for 0.0.4]
(https://github.com/firebaseco/mongoose-attachments/blob/v0.0.4/README.md).


### Installation

* [mongoose-attachments-localfs](https://github.com/firebaseco/mongoose-attachments-localfs)
* [mongoose-attachments-aws2js](https://github.com/firebaseco/mongoose-attachments-aws2js)
* [mongoose-attachments-knox](https://github.com/firebaseco/mongoose-attachments-knox)

Note: Mongoose-Attachments is bundled with each provider.


### Usage

The following example extends the 'Post' model to use attachments with a property called 'image' and three different styles.

    var mongoose = require('mongoose');
    var attachments = require('mongoose-attachments-aws2js');
    var PostSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
      title: String,
      description: String
    });
    
    PostSchema.plugin(attachments, {
      directory: 'achievements',
        storage: {
          providerName: 's3',
          options: {
          key: '<key>',
          secret: '<secret>',
          bucket: '<bucket>'
        }
      },
      properties: {
        image: {
          styles: {
            original: {
              // keep the original file
            },
            small: {
              resize: '150x150'
            },
            medium: {
              resize: '120x120'
            },
            medium_jpg: {
              '$format': 'jpg' // this one changes the format of the image to jpg
            }
          }
        }
      }
    });
	
    var Post = mongoose.model('Post', PostSchema);

#### Using with Express.js uploads

Assuming that the HTML form sent a file in a field called 'image':

    app.post('/upload', function(req, res, next) {
      var post = new mongoose.model('Post')();
      post.title = req.body.title;
      post.description = req.body.description;
      post.attach('image', req.files.image, function(err) {	
        if(err) return next(err);
        post.save(function(err) {
          if(err) return next(err);
          res.send('Post has been saved with file!');
        });
      })	
    });


#### Using with an stand-alone app files

    var post = new mongoose.model('Post')();
    post.title = 'Title of the Post';
    post.description = 'Description of the Post';
    post.attach('image', {
        path: '/path/to/the/file.png'
      }, function(err) {	
        if(err) return next(err);
        post.save(function(err) {
          if(err) return next(err);
          console.log('Post has been Saved with file');
        });
    })	


#### Using Local Storage

With [mongoose-attachments-localfs](https://github.com/firebaseco/mongoose-attachments-localfs).

    // further up: var path = require('path');
    
    MySchema.plugin(attachments, {
      directory: '/absolute/path/to/public/images',
      storage : {
        providerName: 'fs'
      },
      properties: {
        image: {
          styles: {
            original: {
              // keep the original file
            },
            thumb: {
              thumbnail: '100x100^',
              gravity: 'center',
              extent: '100x100',
              '$format': 'jpg'
            },
            detail: {
              resize: '400x400>',
              '$format': 'jpg'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    });
    MySchema.virtual('detail_img').get(function() {
      return path.join('detail', path.basename(this.image.detail.path));
    });
    MySchema.virtual('thumb_img').get(function() {
      return path.join('thumb', path.basename(this.image.thumb.path));
    });

The URL to the images would then be `http://<your host>/<mount path>/images` prepended to the value of `MyModel.detail_img` and `MyModel.thumb_img`.


### Metadata

When mongoose-attachments is used with images, it can provide basic information for each one of the specified styles:

Example:

    {
      "dims" : {
        "w" : 120,
        "h" : 103
      },
      "depth" : 8,
      "format" : "PNG",
      "oname" : "dragon.png",
      "mtime" : ISODate("2012-05-22T06:21:53Z"),
      "ctime" : ISODate("2012-05-22T06:21:53Z"),
      "size" : 26887,
      "path" : "/achievements/4fbaaa31db8cec0923000019-medium.png",
      "defaultUrl" : "http://gamygame-dev.s3.amazonaws.com/achievements/4fbaaa31db8cec0923000019-medium.png"
    }

### Styles and ImageMagick Transformations

Transformations are achieved by invoking the **convert** command from ImageMagick and passing all the properties of the style as arguments.

For more information about convert, take a look at http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php

Example in convert command:

    convert source.png -resize '50%' output.png

Example in plugin options:

    styles: {
      small: {
        resize: '50%'
      }
    }

#### Keeping the Original File

    styles: {
      original: {
        // no transformations
      }
    }

#### Multiples Transformations

Use another properties under the style to provide more transformations

    styles: {
      small: {
        crop: '120x120',
        blur: '5x10' //radius x stigma
      }
    }

More information about 'blur' at the [ImageMagick website] http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php#blur

#### Changing the Destination Format

You can change the destination format by using the special transformation '$format' with a known file extension like *png*, *jpg*, *gif*, etc.

Example:

    styles: {
      as_jpeg: {
        '$format': 'jpg'
      }
    }

Note: **DO NOT** include the dot in the extension.

#### Supported Formats

There are two possibilities to define which file formats should be supported:

1. white list (default)
2. formats listed with certain flags by `convert -list format`

##### White List

The default white list contains:

* PNG
* GIF
* TIFF
* JPEG

To add a format call the following method before using the plugin in the mongoose schema:

    attachments.registerDecodingFormat('BMP');

##### Formats Provided by ImageMagick

ImageMagick (or GraphicsMagick) list the supported formats when calling `convert -list format` (or `identify`).
The formats are flagged to show which operations are supported with each:

* `*` native blob support (only ImageMagick, not GraphicsMagick)
* `r` read support
* `w` write support
* `+` support for multiple images

You can register the formats that are supported for read operation like so:

    attachments.registerImageMagickDecodingFormats();

To register formats supporting different operations there is a more general function. Specifying certain operations will select only those formats that support all of them. Formats supporting only a subset won't be included. The following call yields the list of formats that support `read`,`write`,`multi`:

    attachments.registerImageMagickFormats({ read: true, write: true, multi: true });

If you want to use the output list that was generated for your own benefit you can specify a callback as second argument to that above method. Note, however, that in that case the supported decoding formats won't be changed on the plugin.

You could use that callback to assure that the formats you want your client to support are indeed supported by the backing ImageMagick (or GraphicsMagick) installation. For example, checking TIFF support:

    attachments.registerImageMagickFormats({ read: true }, function(error, formats) {
      if (error) throw new Error(error);
      else if (formats && formats.length > 0) {
        if (formats.indexOf('TIFF') < 0) {
          throw new Error('No TIFF support!');
        }
      } else {
        throw new Error("No formats supported for decoding!");
      }
    });
